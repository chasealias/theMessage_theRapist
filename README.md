theMessage_theRapist
====================

Marshall McLuhan was quoted as saying the medium is the message.  Years later he finished writing his book, "The Medium is the Massage"  When asked why he changed what he said for the title of his now imfamous Computer Age Philosophy and New Media Book he responded, "It must be a typo."   

Genius is always well crafted and perfectly conceptualised especially if forsight is not so apparent. theMessage_theRapist will be code to an app that will grab meta data from ideas.  These ideas are input by the apps users. Algorythmic data and meta data from well known quotes, philosophies and concepts will be combined with and rearranged into new "IDEAS".  The words from both short form statements, the user's and the famed, should animate using automators and the algorithm based on the original artist whose words they may have been,  It will ideally stand as a public work of New Media Scuplture which will grow and expand eternally. -D.S.
